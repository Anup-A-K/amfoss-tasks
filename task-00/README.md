So I installed ubuntu 20.04.1 into a pendrive using balena-etcher.
booted into ubuntu that pendrive.
Installed ubuntu into a external ssd with 8 gb as swap area and remaining as ext4 type storage to use ubuntu.
I have installed kali linux and ubuntu few times before so this was not that hard to install.
