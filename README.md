## My views about the tasks
Tasks were challenging and were hard to understand where as few were easy to do. Like codes part needed more logic. Overall it was a nice experience doing these other than academics.
## My Introduction
Hello There! I am Anup A Koujalgi from Davangere, Karnataka. I am an average level coder, still exploring different coding languages. I was exposed to coding in this college only did not that much of idea what these are. I mainly like web development, Data Science, App development...:loading:. To Enhance my self in this greater domain and do more projects and hackthons. The better way of doing this is joining clubs.

1. Why must we choose you?                
	As I am still exploring. Club is a best way to explore it.
	Many people with same intrests, which will help to grow.
2. What is your plan for the next 6 months?            
	Would like to learn react, django flutter.
	And do projects and participate in hackathons.
3. How would you contribute back to the club?           
	By contributing in projects and more.
4. Do you have any feedback on the selection process?             
	Like when I tried doing tasks in 1st sem I had no prior knowledege in 
	CS area.
	At that time it was hard to do the tasks. And couldnt qualify to join the 
	club.
